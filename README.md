# cdecl
Parses C declarations into a human readable form

I can't remember why I did this -- there already exist tools for this (cdecl.org !!).

Just did this for fun I guess. Just hacked together a Python script cos why not.

## Platforms

Should work on Linux systems with python3 installed (python2 won't work!).

Dunno about Mac OS X -- I guess with python3 it should work...

On Windows (with python3 installed), you should use the "Windows Terminal"
from the Microsoft Store for the best results, since the default Command Prompt
(a) sucks, and (b) can't show colours properly (will print out gobbledygook
characters instead).
